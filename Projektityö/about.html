    <p>We work closely with a caring dog shelter in Romania to help shelter dogs find loving, forever homes in Finland and locally in Romania. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome dogs in need, while spreading awareness about responsible pet ownership.</p>
    <p>Through our adoption programs, foster network, and educational initiatives, we strive to create a world where every dog has a safe and loving home. Join us in making a difference, one paw at a time!</p>

    <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
    <p>
        Rescue Dogs was founded by a close-knit family with a lifelong commitment to animal welfare. Animals have always been part of our everyday lives, and every one of our founders shares their home with a rescued dog or cat who once had no place to go. Wanting to do more than help only our own pets, we decided to focus our efforts beyond our borders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, we have witnessed real change. Awareness has grown, conditions have improved, and more families are opening their homes to shelter dogs. Knowing that progress is possible has only strengthened our determination to continue.
    </p>
    <p>Since our early days, collaboration with local shelters in Romania has been at the heart of everything we do. Our first partnerships gave us valuable insight, trust, and understanding of the challenges faced by long-term shelter dogs. Through dedicated volunteers and shared knowledge, dogs once considered “unadoptable” began finding loving homes.</p>

    <p>Today, the situation looks very different from when we started. Many dogs now find families locally, which is a positive sign of change. As a result, we focus our efforts where help is most urgently needed — supporting shelters in rural areas and smaller communities, where resources are limited and every helping hand truly matters. </p>
