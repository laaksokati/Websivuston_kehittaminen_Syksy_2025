    <h1>Adoption - a Shared Commitment</h1>

    <h2>Welcoming a Rescue Dog</h2>
    <p>Welcoming a rescue dog into your home means more than gaining a companion — it means becoming part of a larger effort to protect and care for animals in need. Every adoption opens a new space at a shelter and creates hope for another dog still waiting.</p>
   </section>

   <section class="content">
    <h2>Responsibilities of Adoption</h2>
    <p>While adoption is deeply rewarding, it also comes with responsibility. Rescue dogs may need time, patience, and understanding as they adjust to a new life. There may be unexpected moments along the way, and that is completely normal. We encourage adopters to give both themselves and their dog the time needed to build trust and confidence together.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
    <h2>Matching Dogs with Families</h2>
    <p>Our team works carefully to match each dog with the right family. This process involves experienced adoption coordinators as well as the shelter staff who know the dogs best through daily care. Although a shelter environment can never fully reflect a dog’s true personality, this combined knowledge helps us make thoughtful and informed decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
    <h2>Finding the Perfect Match</h2>
    <p>Even with experience, finding the perfect match is not always easy. That’s why we take every application seriously and do our very best to ensure each dog is placed in a home where they can truly thrive. Our coordinators have years of hands-on experience and have successfully helped hundreds of dogs begin new lives.</p>

    <h2>The Adoption Process</h2>
    <p>The adoption process starts with an application, followed by a phone conversation with one of our adoption coordinators. Trust is at the heart of everything we do. We believe in honest communication and in treating potential adopters with respect. There are no home inspections or interrogations, just an open conversation.</p>
    <p>By trusting one another, we accept that adoption is a journey and not every step can be perfectly predicted. All we ask is honesty throughout the process. You don’t need to be perfect, just ready to offer care, commitment, and a safe place for a dog to call home.</p>
    <p>Once a suitable family has been confirmed and the adoption is approved, an adoption fee is requested. After this, preparations for the dog’s journey to their new home will begin.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How long does the adoption process take?</summary>
        <p>
            The timeline can vary depending on the dog and the number of applications.
            Once we receive your application, we carefully review it and contact suitable
            applicants for a phone conversation.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do you require a home visit?</summary>
        <p>
            No. We do not conduct home inspections. Our adoption process is built on trust
            and open communication.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I adopt if I’ve never had a dog before?</summary>
        <p>
            Absolutely. Previous experience is helpful, but not required. What matters most is your willingness to learn, be patient, and commit to your dog’s well-being.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does the adoption fee include?</summary>
        <p>
            The adoption fee helps cover veterinary care, vaccinations, microchipping,
            travel costs, and daily care at the shelter.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What if things don’t go as planned?</summary>
        <p>
            If challenges arise, we encourage adopters to contact us so we can work
            together to find the best solution for both the dog and the family.
