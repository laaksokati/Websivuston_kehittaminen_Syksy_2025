    <h2>Thinking about a rescue dog?</h2>
    <p>Finding the right dog is more than just bringing a pet home – it’s about building a lasting friendship. Consider what kind of companion fits your daily life, home environment, and energy levels.

Every dog has unique needs and personality, so think about the guidance and training they might require. Are you ready to provide patience, care, and if needed, seek support from professionals to help your new friend thrive?</p>
